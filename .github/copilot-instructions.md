# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Git Commit Messages
* When generating a git commit message, include the JIRA story number from the branch name. The branch name will follow the format `CT-123`, where `123` is the story number. Ensure the story number is included at the beginning of the commit message in the format: CT-123: [commit message]
* For example, if the branch name is `CT-123`, the commit message could be something like: `CT-123: update README.md with new instructions`

## Pull Request Descriptions
* When generating a pull request description, use the template provided in [pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md). Populate the "Related Story Number" section with a link to the JIRA story number extracted from the branch name. If the branch name is `CT-123`, the link should be formatted as: [CT-123](https://jira.example.com/browse/CT-123)
* Additionally:
    - Provide a high-level overview of the changes in the "Overview" section (two sentences max).
    - Use the `differences.txt` file generated by the `create-pr-description` makefile target to summarize the changes in the "Description" section.
* Ensure the output is in Markdown format and adheres to the structure of the pull request template.
